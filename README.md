# Cross Popper

This is a simple Unity game where you can generate crosses by clicking on tiles within a grid. 
If you manage to connect at least three crosses, they will disappear.

## TODO: core game mechanics 
1. **60-Second Countdown**: Once the grid size is selected, a 60-second countdown timer will begin. You need to strategize and generate crosses on the grid within this time limit.

2. **Cross Connection**: Be careful not to connect three or more crosses horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If three or more crosses are connected, they will disappear, reducing your score.

3. **Populate the Grid**: Your goal is to populate as many tiles as possible with crosses without connecting them.

4. **Score Calculation**: After the game ends, the screen will display the percentage of the grid tiles that are populated with crosses. The higher the percentage, the better your performance!
